# Chatbot with Deep Learning

**Overview**

  This project implements a chatbot using deep learning techniques. The chatbot is designed to understand and respond to user queries based on a trained model.

**Features**

  Natural Language Processing (NLP): Utilizes NLP techniques for text processing.
  
  Deep Learning Model: Uses a neural network for intent classification.
    
  Interactive Chat Interface: Provides a user-friendly chat experience.
    
  Pre-trained Word Embeddings: Uses word embeddings to enhance understanding.
    
  Customizable Training Data: Can be trained on different datasets.

**Dependencies**

To run this project, install the following dependencies:

    pip install tensorflow numpy nltk json

**Dataset**

  The chatbot is trained on a dataset consisting of intents, patterns, and responses stored in a JSON file.

**Model Architecture**

The model consists of:

  Input Layer: Processes tokenized user inputs.
  
  Hidden Layers: Uses dense layers with activation functions.
  
  Output Layer: Predicts the intent category.

Usage

  Run the chatbot script and start chatting with the bot.

  Modify intents.json to add new intents and responses.
